CHRISTINA G. ROSSETTI</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Songs</span> light as these
may sound, though deep and strong<br />
The heart spake through them, scarce should hope to please<br />
Ears tuned to strains of loftier thoughts than throng<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Songs light as these.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet grace may set their sometime doubt at
ease,<br />
Nor need their too rash reverence fear to wrong<br />
The shrine it serves at and the hope it sees.</p>
<p class="poetry">For childlike loves and laughters thence
prolong<br />
Notes that bid enter, fearless as the breeze,<br />
Even to the shrine of holiest-hearted song,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Songs light as these.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Goodnight</span> and
goodbye to the life whose signs denote us<br />
As mourners clothed with regret for the life gone by;<br />
To the waters of gloom whence winds of the dayspring float us<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Goodnight and goodbye.</p>
<p class="poetry">A time is for mourning, a season for grief to
sigh;<br />
But were we not fools and blind, by day to devote us<br />
As thralls to the darkness, unseen of the sundawn&rsquo;s
eye?</p>
<p class="poetry">We have drunken of Lethe at length, we have
eaten of lotus;<br />
What hurts it us here that sorrows are born and die?<br />
We have said to the dream that caressed and the dread that smote
us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Goodnight and goodbye.</p>
<h3><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>II.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Outside of the port ye are moored in, lying<br

Close from the wind and at ease from the tide,<br />
What sounds come swelling, what notes fall dying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside?</p>
<p class="poetry">They will not cease, they will not abide:<br />
Voices of presage in darkness crying<br />
Pass and return and relapse aside.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ye see not, but hear ye not wild wings
flying<br />
To the future that wakes from the past that died?<br />
Is grief still sleeping, is joy not sighing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside?</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> wind&rsquo;s way
in the deep sky&rsquo;s hollow<br />
None may measure, as none can say<br />
How the heart in her shows the swallow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wind&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hope nor fear can avail to stay<br />
Waves that whiten on wrecks that wallow,<br />
Times and seasons that wane and slay.</p>
<p class="poetry">Life and love, till the strong night swallow<br

Thought and hope and the red last ray,<br />
Swim the waters of years that follow<br />

How the time should come for hearts to sigh in saying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Had I wist&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Surely not the roses, laughing as they
kissed,<br />
Not the lovelier laugh of seas in sunshine swaying,<br />
Should have lured my soul to look thereon and list.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now the wind is like a soul cast out and
praying<br />
Vainly, prayers that pierce not ears when hearts resist:<br />
Now mine own soul sighs, adrift as wind and straying,<br />

<h3>I.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Years</span> upon years, as
a course of clouds that thicken<br />
Thronging the ways of the wind that shifts and veers,<br />
Pass, and the flames of remembered fires requicken<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Years upon years.</p>
<p class="poetry">Surely the thought in a man&rsquo;s heart hopes
or fears<br />
Now that forgetfulness needs must here have stricken<br />
Anguish, and sweetened the sealed-up springs of tears.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah, but the strength of regrets that strain and
sicken,<br />
Yearning for love that the veil of death endears,<br />
Slackens not wing for the wings of years that quicken&mdash;<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Years upon years.</p>
<h3><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>II.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Years upon years, and the flame of love&rsquo;s
high altar<br />
Trembles and sinks, and the sense of listening ears<br />
Heeds not the sound that it heard of love&rsquo;s blithe
psalter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Years upon years.</p>
<p class="poetry">Only the sense of a heart that hearkens
hears,<br />
Louder than dreams that assail and doubts that palter,<br />
Sorrow that slept and that wakes ere sundawn peers.</p>
<p class="poetry">Wakes, that the heart may behold, and yet not
falter,<br />
Faces of children as stars unknown of, spheres<br />
Seen but of love, that endures though all things alter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Years upon years.</p>
<h3><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p class="poetry">Years upon years, as a watch by night that
passes,<br />
Pass, and the light of their eyes is fire that sears<br />
Slowly the hopes of the fruit that life amasses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Years upon years.</p>
<p class="poetry">Pale as the glimmer of stars on moorland
meres<br />
Lighten the shadows reverberate from the glasses<br />
Held in their hands as they pass among their peers.</p>
<p class="poetry">Lights that are shadows, as ghosts on graveyard
grasses,<br />
Moving on paths that the moon of memory cheers,<br />
Shew but as mists over cloudy mountain passes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Years upon years.</p>

Heart of life, laid waste with wasting flame<br />
Ere the change of things and thoughts requicken,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Time, thy name.</p>
<p class="poetry">Girt about with shadow, blind and lame,<br />
Ghosts of things that smite and thoughts that sicken<br />
Hunt and hound thee down to death and shame.</p>
<p class="poetry">Eyes of hours whose paces halt or quicken<br />
Read in bloodred lines of loss and blame,<br />
Writ where cloud and darkness round it thicken,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Time, thy name.</p>

Speak: is grief the last gift of my dealing?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, but rest.</p>
<p class="poetry">All the world is wearied, east and west,<br />
Tired with toil to watch the slow sun wheeling,<br />
Twelve loud hours of life&rsquo;s laborious quest.</p>
<p class="poetry">Eyes forspent with vigil, faint and reeling,<br

Find at last my comfort, and are blest,<br />
Not with rapturous light of life&rsquo;s revealing&mdash;<br />

One shelter where our spirits fain would be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Death, if thou wilt?</p>
<p class="poetry">No dome with suns and dews impearled and
gilt,<br />
Imperial: but some roof of wildwood tree,<br />
Too mean for sceptre&rsquo;s heft or swordblade&rsquo;s hilt.</p>
<p class="poetry">Some low sweet roof where love might live, set
free<br />
From change and fear and dreams of grief or guilt;<br />
Canst thou not leave life even thus much to see,<br />

<p class="poetry">Thy fruits of life, and blossoms of thy
bough,<br />
What are they but my seedlings?&nbsp; Earth and sea<br />
Bear nought but when I breathe on it must bow.</p>
<p class="poetry">Bow thou too down before me: though thou be<br

Great, all the pride shall fade from off thy brow,<br />
When Time and strong Oblivion ask of thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Man, what art thou?</p>

Immortal; if thou make us nought, or we<br />
Survive: thy power is made but of our dread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Death, if thou be.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thy might is made out of our fear of thee:<br

Who fears thee not, hath plucked from off thine head<br />
The crown of cloud that darkens earth and sea.</p>
<p class="poetry">Earth, sea, and sky, as rain or vapour shed,<br

Shall vanish; all the shows of them shall flee:<br />
Then shall we know full surely, quick or dead,<br />

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> heavenly bay,
ringed round with cliffs and moors,<br />
Storm-stained ravines, and crags that lawns inlay,<br />
Soothes as with love the rocks whose guard secures<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heavenly bay.</p>
<p class="poetry">O friend, shall time take ever this away,<br />
This blessing given of beauty that endures,<br />
This glory shown us, not to pass but stay?</p>
<p class="poetry">Though sight be changed for memory, love
ensures<br />
What memory, changed by love to sight, would say&mdash;<br />
The word that seals for ever mine and yours<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heavenly bay.</p>

What new delight of waters, may this be,<br />
The fairest found since time&rsquo;s first breezes fanned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother sea?</p>
<p class="poetry">Once more I give me body and soul to thee,<br
/>
Who hast my soul for ever: cliff and sand<br />
Recede, and heart to heart once more are we.</p>
<p class="poetry">My heart springs first and plunges, ere my
hand<br />
Strike out from shore: more close it brings to me,<br />
More near and dear than seems my fatherland,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother sea.</p>

<p class="poetry">Across and along, as the bay&rsquo;s breadth
opens, and o&rsquo;er us<br />
Wild autumn exults in the wind, swift rapture and strong<br />
Impels us, and broader the wide waves brighten before us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Across and along.</p>
<p class="poetry">The whole world&rsquo;s heart is uplifted, and
knows not wrong;<br />
The whole world&rsquo;s life is a chant to the sea-tide&rsquo;s

Are we not as waves of the water, as notes of the song?</p>
<p class="poetry">Like children unworn of the passions and toils

We breast for a season the breadth of the seas that throng,<br />
Rejoicing as they, to be borne as of old they bore us<br />

<p class="poetry">On Dante&rsquo;s track by some funereal
spell<br />
Drawn down through desperate ways that lead not back<br />
We seem to move, bound forth past flood and fell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On Dante&rsquo;s track.</p>
<p class="poetry">The grey path ends: the gaunt rocks gape: the
black<br />
Deep hollow tortuous night, a soundless shell,<br />
Glares darkness: are the fires of old grown slack?</p>
<p class="poetry">Nay, then, what flames are these that leap and
swell<br />
As &rsquo;twere to show, where earth&rsquo;s foundations

From heaps of dry waste whin and casual brands:<br />
Yet, knowing, we scarce believe it kindled so<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By mere men&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p class="poetry">Above, around, high-vaulted hell expands,<br />
Steep, dense, a labyrinth walled and roofed with woe,<br />
Whose mysteries even itself not understands.</p>
<p class="poetry">The scorn in Farinata&rsquo;s eyes aglow<br />
Seems visible in this flame: there Geryon stands:<br />
No stage of earth&rsquo;s is here, set forth to show<br />

Hungers here, barred up for ever, whence as one whom dreams
affright<br />
Day recoils before the low-browed lintel threatening doom and
casting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Night.</p>
<p class="poetry">All the reefs and islands, all the lawns and
highlands, clothed with light,<br />
Laugh for love&rsquo;s sake in their sleep outside: but here the

Day with silent speech and scorn of all things known from depth

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
